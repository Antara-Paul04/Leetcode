# Two Sum Problem

This repository contains my Python solution to the "Two Sum" problem on LeetCode.

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, the task is to find the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
